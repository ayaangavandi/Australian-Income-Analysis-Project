# 🇦🇺 Australian Income Analysis by Age, State & Sex using SQL, Excel & Tableau  

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project analyses income data across Australia segmented by **age groups**, **states**, and **sex**, leveraging **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Tableau** to generate clean insights and interactive visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean, integrate and analyse income data across demographics and geography.  
- Use SQL to construct structured datasets and perform joins/views for demographic segmentation.  
- Use Excel to explore, validate and transform raw data.  
- Use Tableau to build interactive dashboards that reveal patterns in income distribution by age, region and gender.  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Microsoft Excel** → Data exploration, cleaning and transformation  
- **SQL (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL or Database of choice)** → Creating views, performing joins and demographic segmentation  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards and visual analytics  

---

## 🧩 Process & Approach  
1. **Data Preparation (Excel):**  
   - Imported raw datasets, handled missing/duplicate values, standardized columns.  
   - Used Excel functions & pivot tables to preview data distribution by age, state, sex.

2. **Database Modelling (SQL):**  
   - Loaded cleaned data into database tables.  
   - Created views by demographic segments: age groups, states, sexes.  
   - Executed SQL queries to derive income metrics (median, average, percentiles) across segments.

3. **Visualization (Tableau):**  
   - Built interactive dashboard showing income across states, by age group, and by gender.  
   - Added filters for age group, state and sex to allow dynamic exploration.  
   - Highlighted key trends and comparisons: e.g., how income varies by gender within states and age bands.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- 🔹 The **average income** increases consistently with **age groups**, but the rate of increase slows after certain age thresholds.  
- 🔹 Certain **states** show higher median incomes across several age groups and sexes.  
- 🔹 A **gender income gap** persists across many states and age groups, with variance depending on region.  
- 🔹 Income distribution varies significantly by **age-sex-state cross segment**, indicating layered demographic impact.
